// export const eq = "EQ (aka equalizing) is one of the easiest types of processing to understand, \n
// because most people have done some form of EQing at some point in a car or on a stereo--it's the process of changing \n
// the relative volumes of different parts of the frequency spectrum within a sound. Any time you've \n
// turned up the bass or the treble on any kind of speakers, youve been EQing! Within a mix its important to make \n
// sure that you can hear everything, which means 'carving out' space for each instrument to sit by adding or \n
// subtracting frequency so that nothing is 'masking' anything else. Without doing this, similar sounds would cancel \n
// each other out, like how the voices of a lot of people at a party make it tough to hear what any one voice is saying."
